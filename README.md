# [Built With Ember Website](http://builtwithember.io)

A list of ambitious web applications built using [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).

This project was inspired by a Google Drive spreadsheet that was shared on Twitter sometime ago. We thought that it might be a good idea to have a site listing all the cool projects built using ember.js so we made it.

### Submissions
We are trying to keep the site submission quality as high as possible. Please only submit real world applications running in production environments. Make sure that you can link to the application directly and no demos or proof-of-concepts. Only finished applications allowed.

### How to submit
To submit a site suggestions, [open an issue](https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-ember/issues/new) or create a pull request. Pull requests will be given higher priority since they are easier to include.

Make sure the screenshot is **1000x800** and please double check that everything looks good before submitting.

### Running the site locally
```
$ gem install jekyll
$ git clone https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-ember.git
$ cd built-with-ember
$ jekyll serve --watch
```
